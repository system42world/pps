== ARCHITECTURE CHARACTERISTICS

*Securability*

- API Gateway integrates with the IdP of the enterprise to authorize requests to the engine.
- Flink ingests commands via Kafka cluster that utilizes built-in security
- Extensions protect their endpoints via OpenID
- Extension Manager adds an access token to outgoing calls
- Network connections are protected via TLS

*Reliability & Availability*

- The engine continues to accept payment initiation requests for further processing even if Flink is unavailable
- If Transaction Processor, Extension Manager, or any extension is unavailable, Stateful Functions runtime retries requests until success
- If Transactions service is not available, it does not miss any progress events due to PubSub between Flink and itself

*Interoperability*

- The engine provides API over HTTPS to initiate a payment transaction or query transaction data
- The engine provides API over HTTPS for extension self-registration
- Engine APIs published as OpenAPI documents
- Engine APIs preserve backward compatibility
- It’s possible to provide OpenBanking or ISO 20022 compatible APIs as well as any other API via custom adapters for the engine API

*Observability*

- All components have health metrics available for the bank operators and injectable into an enterprise-wide dashboard
- All components support structured logging and redirect logs into central log management solutions
- Transaction statuses and error codes are observable via a Business Operator Web UI
